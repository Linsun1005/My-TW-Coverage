# Master Workflow Documentation: Efficient Batch Enrichment

## Core Philosophy: "Efficiency through Batching & Automation"
This project prioritizes high-throughput enrichment without constant user interruptions. We achieve this by using automated auditing tools and processing entire batch groups in single, coordinated runs.

## 1. Batch Identification & Initial Audit
Instead of searching for files manually, start by identifying the target batch from `task.md`.

1.  **Run Audit**: Run the strict audit script with the verbose flag to identify exactly which tickers need work.
    ```powershell
    python "f:\My TW Coverage\.agent\workflows\audit_batch.py" <batch_num> -v
    ```
2.  **Verify Filenames**: If the audit says a ticker exists but you suspect a name mismatch, verify the filename:
    ```powershell
    python .agent\workflows\find_by_name.py --pattern "<TICKER>_*.md"
    ```
3.  **Identify Targets**: Focus only on tickers listed under `NEEDS ENRICHMENT`.

## 2. The "Group of 10" Execution Loop
To maintain stability and progress tracking, process tickers in groups of **10** at a time.

### Phase A: Research (10 Tickers)
1.  **Research**: Use `search_web` for a group of 10 tickers sequentially.
2.  **Format**: Convert the research into a `DATA` dictionary compatible with `fix_batch.py`.
    -   **Business Intro**: Professional Traditional Chinese, removing all original English.
    -   **Comprehensive Tagging**: Use `[[Wikilinks]]` for **every** key product and technology (e.g. `[[AI 伺服器]]`, `[[ABF 載板]]`). This is the foundation for finding competitors.
    -   **Supply Chain**: Explicit Up/Mid/Downstream sections.
    -   **Clients/Suppliers**: Specific names with `[[link]]` tags.
    -   **Wikilinks**: Ensure all technical terms and partner companies are tagged.

### Phase B: Injection & Execution
1.  **Inject Payload**: Use `replace_file_content` to overwrite the `DATA` dictionary in `f:\My TW Coverage\.agent\workflows\fix_batch.py`.
2.  **Run Script**: Execute the update script:
    ```powershell
    python "f:\My TW Coverage\.agent\workflows\fix_batch.py"
    ```
3.  **Verify**: Re-run the audit flag (`-v`) for the batch to confirm the 10 tickers moved to `CLEAN`.

## 3. General Rules & Best Practices
- **UTF-8 ONLY**: Always use UTF-8 for reading and writing.
- **Data Integrity**: **NEVER** modify or regenerate the Financial Tables section.
- **Traditional Chinese**: All content (Desc, Supply Chain, Clients) must be in Traditional Chinese.
- **Agent Autonomy**: Once a group of 10 is verified clean, move immediately to the next 10 without prompting the user. Only ask for review after the *entire* batch of 30 is complete.
- **No Disposable Scripts**: Always use the `DATA` dict in `fix_batch.py`.

## 4. Anti-Variability & Execution Rigidity
To ensure 100% consistency across sessions and different agents:
- **NO NEW SCRIPTS**: The agent is strictly forbidden from creating temporary Python scripts (e.g., `temp_inject.py`). All data injection MUST happen via the `DATA` dictionary in the canonical `f:\My TW Coverage\.agent\workflows\fix_batch.py`.
- **FIXED COMMAND SET**: Execution must strictly follow the **7-Command Approval Pattern** (1 Audit + 3 loops of 2 commands). Any deviation or "creative" execution manner is a violation of this Skill.
- **TAGGING PARITY**: If a report mentions multiple entities (e.g. `[[Broadcom]]` and `Jabil`), the agent **MUST** tag both. Partial tagging is considered a failure of the Universal Tagging Rule.

## 5. Key Scripts & Tools
- `audit_batch.py`: Discovery and verification.
- `fix_batch.py`: The ONLY authorized script for file updates.
- `enrich-ticker.md`: Detailed report formatting rules.

---

## 5. Standard Operation for "Run Enrichment for Batch X"
When the user gives this command, the agent must:
1. Load this document.
2. Run Step 1 (Audit).
3. Execute Step 2 Phase A & B in loops of 10 until the batch is 100% clean.
4. Notify the user only when the batch is finished or a major blocker is found.
